	The files 'tcsCmd.c' and 'tcsCmd.h' contains the code to get
access to the TCS commands. You should compile and link the program
with the rest of your application.

	Useage is as follows:

- Open the connection:

	char name[40];
	.
	.
	.
	strcpy(name, "ctiox0");	/* ctiox0 is the name of the TCS computer  */
	if (tcsOpen(name)) {	/* if not zero then it's an error    	   */
		.
		.
	}
	.
	.

- Communicate with the TCS:

	char line[128];
	.
	.
	.
	strcpy(line, "info");	/* get coordinates with command 'info'	  */
	if (sendTCS(line)) {	/* if not zero then it's an error	  */
		.
		.
	}
	.			/* the answer is in 'line'		  */
	.

- Make sure the label  TCP_MSG_PROG in the tcsCmd.h file match the
  SRV_MSG_PROG label in the server side.

This directory contains a serial port driver that can be utilized
from LabVIEW. The driver is included in the shared library
libserial_lv.so, and the functions are called using the Call Library
convention. An example of use is found in LVserial.vi.

There are four functions in the driver, with the following
calling conventions:

int LVcomm_open_port(int *fd, LStrHandle port_name, int baudrate)

	This function performs the open to the port. It returns an
	"fd" that needs to be passed to the other functions. The 
	port_name is a string like "/dev/ttyS0". Finally, the legal
	baudrate numbers are: 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400,
	57600, 115200. The port is set at the selected baudrate,
	8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit. 
	When successful it returns a zero (0). Any other number is
	an indication of error.
	
int LVcomm_close_port(int fd)

	This function closes the port connection.
	
int LVcomm_send_msg(int fd, LStrHandle message)

	This function performs the actual sending of the message. 
	No interpretation of the content is done, and all bytes in
	the message are sent.
	
int LVcomm_get_msg(int fd, LStrHandle message)

	This function receives the actual message. When successful it
	returns a zero (0), indicating the presence of a message. The
	function recognizes the end of a message by the presence of either
	a carriage return or a line feed character. In both cases, the
	resulting string is terminated by a line feed character.

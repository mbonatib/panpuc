	normal, light o single (one). This was there before, but only
	trhouhg direct dbs setting
	* modified Prco_ccd and Proc_ccdIV so they use properly the
	"autonumbering" database variable

2016-02-12T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.94
	* the "expo" and "reset" images do not write header information.

2015-05-12T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.93
	* added support for "autoimnumber" 
	* real time image stats are added into the database

2013-11-08T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.92
	* added "adpabuff" flag on ccd (single) to make it 
	adapt the size of the requested raw buffer on demand instead
	of request the complete image buffer at the beginning
	(to save as muc memory as possible)

2013-02-08T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.91
	* fixed problem in ccd (single) sampling

2012-12-08T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.9
	* added a delay inside the loop for ccdIV to avoid consumming too much
	CPU time

2012-05-30T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.8
	* fixed the coadd3 routine in LogicLib, that was truncating the
	real values into integer when fsamples > 1

2012-05-30T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.7
	* fixed sampling Proc_SUR that had a missing connection

2012-05-30T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.6
	* replaced dpouble_t with pan_double_t to avoid conflicts with
	mathdefs.h in newer distributions

2012-04-22T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.5
	* fixed Proc_DCS that had lost a reference somehow

2011-06-06T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.4
	* minor changes to improve speed 
	* updated DEP

2011-05-16T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.3
	* added a new parameter ("interchannels") for the multframes
	sampling (all samples from one channel first or all the
	channels interleaved bewteen the samples -default)

2011-03-14T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.2
	* compiled the C code ina  64 bits machine (to test)

2011-03-14T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.1
	* added logic process "multframes" that allows to
	"fowler sample" a visible image, or average  consecutive
	 pixel samplings (as for an skipper amplifier)

2011-03-14T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 6.0
	* changed to handle or the in/out pointers as 64 bits
	* changed the C functions and also the labview vis
	* the c functions changed to use custom datatypes

2011-03-14T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.7
	* fixed Proc_ccdIV so the number of images is read inside
	 the while loop, allowing a correct handling if the numbe rof
	 images changes during a sequence

2010-12-28T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.6
	* Procs ccd and ccdIV send an ACQERR command to the fits server when
	  the acquisition was not completed 

2010-09-26T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.5
	* fixed the U16 type to imnumber (so it can effectively use
	image numbers above 65535. Changed in Main, and algosr ccd, ccdIVand
ccdold

2010-09-26T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.4
	* added an outpout sondition to "single" sampling

2010-09-16T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.3
	* fixed "single" sampling that had a problem with the last buffer
	* added the listing of the arguments for command upon "?"

2010-09-16T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.2
	* modified ccdIV (singframe) to create the image when exposing, when
	  read starts (default) or when read ends 
	* added the command set/det "createwhen" (default : onreadstart)

2010-09-16T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.1
	* Modified ccdIV (singframe) to create the image when the read
	progress is >0, that way the image creation time gets covered
	by the read time
	* Modified ccd_set_image so the unscrambler does not wait for the fits
	server when the "compute" is set (waitfits no). That way the create
	image time does not delay the start of the unscrambling. the wait
	parameter (waitfits yes <time>) gets restored after the "compute"

2010-08-11T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 5.0
	* changed to pass the error messages back (error in Main)
	* the Procs do NOT delete the frames, just in case another observation is
	   being taken (compatible with multiple concurrent observations)
	* the fits status was removed from here and moved to the fits server

2010-04-12T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.96
	* If the memory or something fails, it deletes all the frames
	  in frame manager, to avoid locked buffers

2009-11-01T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.95
	* Fixed procd ccd, ccd2, and ccdIV to NOT increment the
	image number when image is not being writte automatically
	
2009-09-01T02:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.94
	* increased unstmout default to 35 secs

2009-04-01T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.93
	* fixed a problem with CCD2 (for non-multiple of 2 buffers). 
	  Not fully tested yet

2009-04-01T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.92
	* added CCD2 sampling, not fully tested

2009-03-25T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.91
	* fixed a possible race condition on set_ccd_image (on Algors)
 	  (reported by D. Hale, Caltech)

2009-01-25T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.9
	* fixed setup_ccd (a unsc_timeou was still hardwired

2009-01-12T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.8
	* no OSU svn tags anymore
	 changed the "continuous" so it will compuet also the memfits
	 parameter to send or not fits commands (write, etc)
	* the unsc timeout is a config. parameter now (not hardwired anymore)

2007-11-29T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.7
	* added the OSU svn tags

2007-07-29T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.6
	* increased the fits timeout to 25 secs (Proc_ccdIV)

2007-05-29T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.5
	* fixed ccd (real time) proc that  got broken at some point

2007-05-29T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.2
	* added the _continuous_ procs (simpler than the others) to support
	   continuous (guide) read
	* add the keyword "available" on the config file, which, if defined,
	  filters the available processes (saving memory)

2007-05-12T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.1
	* cleaned ALGORS which were not in use

2006-11-05T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 4.0
	* cleaned all unused vis and old dirs. Removed DEP with database

2006-10-05T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 3.4
	* changed Proc_CCDIV to behaive like Proc_CCD, in the sense of
	  computing/creating right after the image is being read instead
	  of doing at the begining of the exposure

2006-06-07T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 3.3
	* added the "acoadds" internal variable to record the actual coadds
	  being done (so real amount is recorded on the headers)
	* separated the normalization between "fowler" and "coadds", so
	  the fowler gets normalized always (averaged), and the coadds are
	  accumulated by default. If normalization is requested, then the
	  the coadds are averaged.
	* added the clear of "acoadds" on the Logical module
	  core (before algorith calling)
	* created the vis for getting the last written image name from GFITS,
  	  and increasing the image numbers according to it. In this way the
          "imnumber" will always be last_writen_image + 1
	  (added on Logic_Main.vi, after the algor is finiched)
	* replaced the buildimagename for CMN_buildimagename


2006-05-12T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 3.21
	* Removed a lot of dependencies to Database (old globals),
	  but some are still left. To be finished 

2005-05-12T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 3.2
	* Proc_ccd send now an ABORT command to GFITS when the abort is
	 detected. It also right "aborted TRUE" to the database. Sets
         "aborted FALSE" at the beginning.
	* Logic Main reads the "aborted" key from the database, and if it
	  was aborted, DO NOT increment the image number

2005-05-12T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 3.1
	* Changed the Proc_ccd algor to create and compute the image
	 parameters right after the first piece of image is read rather than
	 at the begining of the exposure. This allows to change ANY parameters 
	  during the exposure (including basename and direcory, etc)

2005-04-19T18:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 3.0
	* Labview 7.0
	* Changed the Proc_ccd algor to equal the exptime key to the
	  aexptime (actual exptime) every time it starts a new image read
	  (this implemented for the "stop_exposure" on DBSP. "stop exposure"
	   changes the exposure time to be the current, so it finishes now.
	  The nest image (is in a sequence will have then the original
	  exptime.

2005-02-19T12:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 1.02
	* taken out the debug by default

2004-12-30T12:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 1.01
	* added the "CMN_addstatusmessage" in order to standarize the callback
	  format: <DONE> | ERROR> [message]
	* added teh ACK reply to the DHE module when there was an error on the
	  readout and it should be aborted


2004-11-23T12:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 1.0
	* Taked out the SDSU global for the callback; now a queue is used for
	returning  the message, and it is the caller in charge og generating
	the callback
	* added the "return_data_pointer" funtion on the Clib, so it is
	  independent on the DHE module (it was using one from the SDSU module
	  before

2004-11-13T12:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.93
	* Replaced CMN_Non-standard-test... for CMN_testpath
	* added timeout=0 (no long commands)


2004-11-12T12:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.92
	* Uses the CMN_GetBuf instead of the SDSU global BufferDimensions


2004-11-12T12:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.91
	* Added the C library on private/c. 
	* Added the Fowler Pixel to Pixel and Line to Line, as well as
	 modified the Proc_FOWLER in order to select automatically from one
	 or another accordign to a database variable
	* Added the "VERSION" command (moved Main and Logical to public/vis)
	
2004-07-02T20:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.10
	* Changed name of the module from LOGIC to Logical to fit the name
	  of the directory
	* Fixed a problem with the log file definition. Now if the algors
	  path specified is wrong (or does not exists) it will search
	  on the defaul Logical/Algors dir. If the log dir specified
	  for the algors does not exists, then it will use the log dir
	  specified for the module itself

2004-02-05T20:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.9
	* Added the Proc_SUR algor for Sample Up the Ramp Mode

2004-02-05T20:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.8
	*  deleted internal SDSUGlobal vi (inside IRDCS.llb)

2004-02-05T20:03:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.7
	* semi-conformed to the read config file standard
	* deleted all the unused controls on the front panel
	* added a local control for commands
	* Moved out of the very old Cmd_Procs

2003-12-03T14:10:21 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.6
	* fixed a problem on the PROC_ccd algor, related to the position of
	 the "Check_STOP" vi

2003-11-14T14:10:21 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.5
	* added the command "resetprogress"t to the GFITS module, so
	  the "writeprogress variabale gets updated everytime a new
	  image is expected

2003-10-02T20:03:09 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.4
	* added the CheckStop to the PROC_ccd algor
	* added the CheckStop message to the final async. message

2003-10-02T20:03:09 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.3

	* added the logfile to the algors

2003-04-23T06:32:09 UTC <Marco Bonati> Logical version 0.2

  Created.

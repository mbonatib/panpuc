2005-08-30T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 3.2
	* changed how the COMMENT is written on the headers. If the template
	  says "dbs FITSCOM <varname>" writes the value of the variable as
	  a comment. For consistency also changed FITSDATE (dbs FITSDATE)

2005-05-07T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 3.1
	* fixed the space problem when specified STR
	* It checks the permissions and generates an error if it can't
	  right the header template

2005-04-19T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 3.0
	* Labview 7.0
	* Fixed probems with the header timing (__BEFORE__ and __AFTER__)
	* fixed problem when deleting a keyword

2005-02-19T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 2.4
	* Removed dependencies with ArcVIEW/Common (except SCL)
	* taken out the debug by default

2004-09-08T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 2.3
	* Added the "VERSION" option (including the header keyword)

2004-04-26T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 2.2
	* Added the "write date" and "write comment" options on the
	  image headers

2004-04-26T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 2.1
	* Added the capabilitie of write keyword headers at the begining or
	  the end of the exposure

2004-04-26T21:18:02 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 2.0
	* ALL the globals from the database module were taken out. Now it uses
	 extenbsivelly the "DBSHANDLER" type of database


2004-03-15T14:10:21 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.11
        * changed the FITS key like TCSINFO, FILT, etc, to go to the first
          extension also. Added cases, for FILTTINFO, and DHETP. Changed the
          GetValuesfromdatabase VI

2004-09-14T14:10:21 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.10
	* added the GetKeyValue.vi. When requesting data to the DBS, now
	  it will keep locally the data previously requested, and it will
	  use the local data (rather tahn asking the DBS again) if it is
	  requiered again (for a diferent extension, for example)
	  in the same image. For a 32 extensions systems, this reduced
	  the time of header gathering from about 200 ms to 35 ms
	* in ImageFinished.vi, changed the call to the DBS for the CMN_toDBS

2003-11-14T14:10:21 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.9
	* added the "resetprogress" key for resetting the "writeprogress"
	 global

2003-10-27T19:17:17 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.8
	* added the "writefrombuffer" function on the c library
	* added the "writeamps" case on the main menu, so it is
	  called from the unscrambler to write directly from the amplifier
	  sructure. If some other calls the fits for writting an image
	  and it passes the standard buffer, it should call the "write"
	  command

2003-10-07T21:38:18 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.7
        *added the DHETP keyword entry (testpoints)

2003-10-03T21:16:36 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.6
	*fixed the multiple extensions thing (kirmos)

2003-04-23T06:32:09 UTC <Marco Bonati> GFITS version 1.4

	*added _DEBUG_ directive to the C source

2003-08-20T00:44:28 UTC

	*Moved "create_file" function call to before "set_values" on "create_img",
avoiding multiples calls if there are many attempts to create the file
		- GF_fitsLib.c
	*added verification of emtpy "hdrfile" template, avoiding the annoying
"which file?" labview dialog. If no hdrfile is specified, then no hdrfile will
be added
		- Modified: GFITS_file2fits.vi
`		 	    GFITS_file2fits_mult.vi

2003-08-21T21:36:20 UTC M.B.

	*fixed mismatch between amplifiers structure and cols/rows handling
when amplifier is rotated.
		- Modified GfitsLib.c
	*added "commands" handling at init (through configuration file)
	*added the capabilitie of changing the extension order throug a
command line. (Map ampkifier --> extension). Added the call to geometry for
ordering the headers of a multiple extension file accordingly
		-Modifier GFITS_Main.vi --> writekey --> extensions
	*Added the if which handles the case when arrive more data than the
totPix specified.
		Modified GfitsLib.c

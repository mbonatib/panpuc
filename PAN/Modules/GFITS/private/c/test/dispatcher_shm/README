sample shared memory test program
---------------------------------

This short example gets a shared memory segment created by panview modules' GFITS, and transmits the fits image from the shared memory segment to the specified host:port.

The program has two threads: the main thread, which is the one that gets the segment, waits for messages from GFITS and
sends the image to the remote host, and the tcpserver thread, that is the one that allows external commands to be given
to the dispatcher itself.

How it works
------------

The GFITS module creates a shared memory segment, and everytime a fits image is ready on the segment, it sends a message, through a queue.
The dispatcher receives the message, the points to the shared memory segment and sends the image to a remote server.
When GFITS exists (panview shuts down), it sends a message that causes the dispatcher to deattach the segment.

In parallel to this (other thread), there is a tcpserver, listening on port 5004. External commands can be given. In the
curent example only two commands are accepted:

SHUTDOWN: causes the program to deattach the segment, and stops both threads
SETDEST <host> <port>: changes the destination to which the fits image will be sent (example: SETDEST localhost 5001)

The shared memory part is all handled byy a shared library (libclishm.so), and all the image seniding is handled by another shared library (libfsender.so)


To compile
---------

just type "make", and it should build noth shared libraries and also the main program (dispatcher)

	  using memroy rules, giving a more flexible memory handling

	* added,in DHE_Calcbuffers.vi a databse key ("memrule") that allows
	  to free unused buffers that do not correspond to the current
	  image needs. The default now is "releasediff", so everytime a new
	  size is generated, it will release all previous buffers of
	 different sizes (if unlocked)

2010-04-06T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 7.1
	* .syncimage is not written to /tmp/.syncimge_<user>_<app>

	have

2009-02-26T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 5.95
	* taken out the useless delay for TPNT that was causing the "close"
	  to take a long time

	  template says "tp grpm_<name>", then the complete <name> group
	  is added into the headers

2008-12-29T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 5.8
	* added the "validrange" parameter to the TPs definitions, so
	  it is possible to specify a range of valid values. If value
	  read is outside the specified range, the last valid value is
	  assumed (this to reject error in reads)
	* The errors are not passed down, but the previous value. The error
	  counter, however, is still increased. The dhe status gets evaluated
	  again at a lower level (closer to the actual read). These changes
	  avoid bad points on the log file (as much as possible)

2008-12-19T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 5.7
	* fixed the inspectname vi. If the string was empty it was

	* From this version we have the OSU svn tags
	* added handling for expID (per image) and obsID (per sequence)

2008-10-24T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 5.3
	* added the set_soft_read_time to DHE, so it passes the calc. to the
	  controller submodule

	* added "get ampinfo"
	* added get/set pixtime
	* changed "DHE_get_timing", so it would reflect if the pixtime changes
	* if get_pixtime returns a valid value, it will use that instead of the file-defined
	  pixtime
	* added get/set pixread and pixwrite algors, to get a set of algors to convert
	  from/to pixel times to hardware units

2008-10-12T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 5.1

2008-08-10T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 4.7
	* added "inspectName", that allows to define a string based on the 
	  variable _FPA_. This may it possible to define initialization files
	  based on the FPA name, to avoid changing names everywhere when a new
	  FPA is defined.

2008-07-18T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 4.6

2007-07-14T18:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> DHE version 2.6
	* Fixed the read timing. Added two new parameters:
	  exp_overhead: it is added to the minimum exposure time
	  minexptime: if stated, overrides the automatic calculation
	  seq_overhead: it is added to the total read time in a sequence
	* All the timing paramaters can be added now in the DHE configuration
	  under [READOUT] instead of the submodule. If they are in the
	  the submodule, then they will be override (so old configs can be
	  kept)
	* the FPA parameters name and modifiers can also be added on the
	  DHE main config file now (under [FPA] name, modifiers)

	  (as SDSU, FLI, EDTP11, etc)
	 This module does all the job of handling commands, etc, passing only
	 the driver-specific commands to the specific dhe module. It also
	 loads some specific long-tasks from the specific dhe module
	(like INIT and READ procedures)

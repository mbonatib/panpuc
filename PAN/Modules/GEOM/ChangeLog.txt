	* It is possible now to discard certain amplifiers from a detector
	intead of discarding the complete deetctor. See documentation

2010-11-08T11:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 9.8
	* fixed the generic header generator to use the amplifier structure
	 instead of the modifiers structure. The problem was that the headers
	  did not appear binned for prescans/overscans even for binned
          modifiers. Fixed during CHIRON (CT60'') somissioning

2010-11-08T11:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 9.7

	  custom WCS

2010-09-10T11:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 9.0
	* Incorporates the "custom" WCS files, and the "on the fly"
	* rearranging of the values depending on the unscrambling order
	

2010-08-13T11:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 8.2

	 sent for the "get headers command"  now -before they could
	  be potentialy delayed by 1

2010-06-04T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 7.1
	* some changes to the API so it won;t be calculating the headers for
	 every command -only when needed. Thsi speeds many geometry comnmands
	and startups

2010-04-04T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 7.0
	* added the "discard" directive to allow readout a detector
	  but noit writing it to disk. Modified the header modules
	  to discard the header information of the discarded amplifiers
	* The amplifier structure ha s a new memner ("discard")
	* fixed a serious problem with detext. if modifiers or binning
	  binning changed the positions of the detectors structure were
	  not being updated, causing misalignemnts and possible crashs

	back to full roi

2009-12-03T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 5.91
	* changed NOAO headers module for the adding the number
	only if Detnumber > 1
	* now it returns the last detformat, that the caller can use
	to avoid coming to the defaults every time

2009-09-28T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 5.9
	* NOAO_DES and NOAO add the dbs variable "fpasize"
	  containing the total size in the "[x1:xe,ys:ye]" format

2009-09-22T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 5.8
	* chenged so "detformat" can now be specified as 
	 "numberxrows", or "colsxnumber" (so it modifies only
	  one dimension as use the default for the other

	  toty and tox sizes, now it is maxy and mayysize/ Changed after
	  header problem seeing under decam45 (data was ok, headers wrong

2009-02-26T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 5.0

	  in rows -not taken into account before

2008-11-17T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 4.92
	* Changed the way the WCS header module calls the NOAO submodule. It 
	  passes an absolute path instead of a relative one. This allows the
	  module to run in a binary distribution without the need of explicit 
	  inclusion in the sources

2008-11-17T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 4.91
	* added the tcp/ip server t the GEOM_GUI

	  application, to which arguments are passed. Added the start_GUI
          script on public/bin. 

2008-10-24T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 4.8
	* added the keyword DETSIZE on the NOAO headers module, so that
	  ds9 is able to "file/open_other/iraf mosaic" directly displaying
	  the mosaic. This also allow direct display using XPA access
	  functions

2008-10-23T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 4.7
	* added "GetStrAmps", that gets information of all or any amp

2008-07-21T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 4.6
	* added support for parametric description of the positions
	  in the FPA, rather than only fixed numbers 
	  ex "POS=(2*cols+1,rows+1), instead of (4097,4097)". This is
	  similar to the description of the amps ikn the readmodes
	* added the capability of multiple refs of the parameter
	  as "1+rows+rows/2" and also crossed refs (cols in rows and
	  rows in cols,  as "(1+cols, cols+rows/2)"
	 
2008-06-21T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 4.5
	* added support for multiple -simetrical- ROIs
	* fixed the problem when the FPA is not a square. It should now be
	* able to handle any shape

	* corrected headers for single extensions, multiple detectors

2007-01-29T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 3.7 
	* added the parameter "binCorrection" to tell how to handle
	  fractions of pixels when binning does not give an integer value
	  Previously it was adding the remaining to the prescans, but now
	  the parameter can tell add to prescans (defaul) by using
	  "add2pre", add to postdata by using "add2pos", or do nothing which
	  is discard the pixels, by using "none". The parameter was 
	  added to the config file (entry [BINNING], key "correction")


2006-05-29T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 3.6 
	* fixed a bug in the calculation of TSEC for single fits headers

	 readmodes. For this added two new vis (GET_ReadModes and
	 GET_AvailableReadmodes, one for the API and one for the internals


2006-01-23T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 3.4 (NOT on repository!)
   	* added the capability of overriding the detector format that is
	  on the config files by sending INIT <FPA_name> -detforma colsXrows
	  This will change the format to all the detector specified on the
	  FPA. Usefull for on-the-fly changes 

2005-11-02T19:01:40 UTC <Marco Bonati> GEOM version 3.3

	* re-fixed the lost reading of template for the headers

2003-08-21T21:43:58 UTC M.B.	GEOM version 1.5

	*Change on the way the rotation is handled. Now it does not swap
	cols and rows, but keep the phisical relation defined independent on the rotation angle. Every C routine (GUNSC, GFITS, GRTD) must to take care of making this swap if needed.
	GUNSC: v 1.5 -->
	GFITS: v 1.5 -->
	GRTD: v 1.3 -->

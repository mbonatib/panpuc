 <b><big>SDSU driver installation</big></b><br>
 <br>
 The San Diego State university controller uses normally a PCI card in order 
to get the data. The PCI card needs to be installed on the system. The system 
comes with e driver module to be installed on the Linux/Solaris machine that 
will run the controller.<br>
 <br>
 The PanVIEW module has in the source the driver, but it also can be downloaded 
from the Astronomical Research Cameras web page (<a href="www.astro-cam.com">www.astro-cam.com</a>)<br>
Currently PanVIEW runs only under kernel 2.6.X only (not 3.X). In the
eventuality of an upgrade, the command set and config would be the same.<br>
 <br>
 For installation of the kernel, the instruction comes with the tarball provided 
in the astro-cam site, and also provided on the SDSU ArcVIEW module, under<br>
 <i><b><br>
 SDSU/private/c/SDSU-III/driver_int/src</b></i><br>
 <br>
 The quick steps in order to have it installed are:<br>
 <br>
a) su (become root)<br>
b) make clean<br>
c) make config<br>
d) make<br>
e) make install<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 make clean; make config will clean any previous binary, and prepare the
files for compilation.<br>
 <br>
 "make" will actually compile the driver.<br>
 The kernel source needs to be installed in order the compilation to succed.<br>
 The Makefile usually include the kernel header files using the statement 
-I /usr/src/linux/include or /usr/src/linux-2.4/include. Verify that such 
path exists on your machine. "linux" and/or "linux-2.4" is usually a symbolic 
link to the actual kernel sources (of the form "linux-2.4.21smp", for example).<br>
 <br>
 Once you have the driver compiled, without errors or warnings. You are ready 
to load it into the kernel.<br>
 For a quick test, just type "astropci_load". This script should load the 
module up to the kernel, and also create the apropiate entries on /dev (usually 
/dev/astropci0).<br>
<br>
Now, type "make install" and the driver will get installed on the modules
tree (usually /lib/modules/&lt;linux_version&gt;/kernel/driver/misc/* or
/lib/modules/&lt;linux_version&gt;/kernel/driver/astropci/*)<br>
 <br>
 Now you may want to make it load at boot time automatically. The simplest
thing, to avoid making all the "standard" initialization for driver modules,
is just to add an entry on /etc/rc.local calling the script for loading the
driver. In the SDSU ArcVIEW module distribution there is also a script called
"astropci_load_system", which loads the driver from the "system" directory
(/lib/modules/&lt;linux_version&gt;/kernel/driver/misc/*) rather than from
the "current" directory as the astropci_load. You can call this script from
the rc.local, or you can copy this script also to some system place, like
/usr/local/bin, and then just add something like:<br>
<br>
<i>#loads SDSU PCI driver module<br>
/usr/local/bin/astropci_load_system<br>
</i><br>
on the rc.local file.<br>
<br>
In this way, every time the computer starts the driver will be automatically
loaded.<br>
<br>
Now, <b>VERY IMPORTANT</b>.<br>
The current version of the driver needs high memory reserved in order to
make the DMA image transfers. This means that some high memory needs to be
reserved for that. <br>
This can be done in both grub or lilo, just adding the statement "mem=XXXM"
to the loader config file (/etc/lilo.conf or /boot/grub/grub.conf), where
XXX is the maximum amount of memory visible for the O,S. The remaining (diference
between XXX and the real, physical memory) will be used for the DMA transfers.
Follow the instruction on the READ_ME file on the driver directory itself.<br>
If you don't do this, the most likely thing to happen is that the computer
will hang when trying to read an image...<br>

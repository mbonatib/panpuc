<h2><big>Detector Head Electronics Modules</big></h2>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>description</big></big><br>
<br>
The DHE Module is in charge of handling the&nbsp; hardware which
controls the actual detector. As such, it normally needs very specific
and
low level commands in order to comunicate with the specific hardware.
This
means that there exists one specific DHE module for each controller
supported,
but all the modules support the same minimum set of commands. Besides
that,
there are some controller specific commands, and some "general"
commands
that are supported by all the controllers.<br>
If there is some special driver that is needed in order to run the
electronics (kernel or unix module driver, for example), then it needs
to be propertly installed on the system. This step must be done
manually, because it is highly dependent on the actual hardware/driver.
In some case this is not needed at
all (for example, the SBIG cameras are normally run through the USB
port, supported as a standard port).<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><big>Basic Initialization</big></h3>
In this section we will describe coarsly how the module get
initializated. By the end of the initizalization process no only the
DHE module is initizalided, but some others that are needed in order to
create an image on disk. In that sense the DHE module acts as a
"master" for those other modules, only in the
sense that it drives the initizaliations automatically.<br>
The initizalization process implies:<br>
<br>
a) Reading the configuration files. For details on this see the
configuration files section at the end. Here we will just say that in
the
config files it is the name of the FPA (Focal Plane Array) to be used.<br>
b) Knowing what is the FPA to be used, the DHE module calls to the GEOM
module, passing to it the name of the FPA to be used. With that
information, the GEOM module passes back to the DHE module information
requiered in order to initizalize itself<br>
THis means that the geometry-related calcculations (size of the array,
general topology -like amount of amplifiers and positions on the
array-, etc) are NOT made on the DHE module, but on the Geometry module
(<a href="../GEOM/GEOM_User_manual.html">GEOM</a>). This module reads a
text "database" wich contents all the information requiered for any
specific FPA (amplifiers positions, type of modifiers allowed -like
overscan, prescans, etc- for that FPA, data size, as well as general
information like manufacturer, detectors serial numbers, both
theoretical and measured parameters for the detectors, types of readout
allowed, etc). When the DHE initializes the FPA,
it just sends to the GEOM module the name of the FPA, and receives back
the information it needs in order to operate it. Same thing when a
modification
is requiered (like overscan change, binning, etc): it sends the
request,
and receives back the new information.&nbsp;<br>
c) Using again the config files, it ask the geometry to re-calculate
things for specifics read on the config file, like for a certain
overscan and/or prescan value, for the specified initial readmode,
etc., and now it calls the GUNSC and <a href="../GFITS/GFITS_User_Manual.html">GFITS</a> module for them to
initizalize based on the geometry information, now complete<br>
d) It goes to the hardware itself and initializes it by doing what is
needed for the specific hardware (like resetting/uploading some
firmware, writting the size of the image to be read, etc).<br>
e) Finally, using again the config files, it may send a series of
custom commands (specified on a init macro) in order to leave the
system in
some desired state (like sampling type, binning, roi, readmode, etc)<br>

generic DHE commands, and the specific module manual for specific
commands.<br>

configuration file using the standard way for the modules (see the <a href="../PanVIEW/PanVIEW_Modules.html">general info on Modules</a>)<br>
<br>
For the DHE module, there are several configuration files, and first
one acts only as the "master" configuration file.<br>

/*this points to the file where "testpoints" are defined. "testpoints"
can be any point of interest that the controller can read/control, like
temperatures, power supplies, etc. The format of the file -if it
exists-
is specific for every supported controller. The definiton of the
testpoits
also allow to add limits for alarms, polling and logging of values.
Having
that it is possible to generate async. alarms when some limit is
reached.
The polling mechanism as well as the logging and alarms are not done by
the
DHE, but by the TPNT (Testpoints) module; the DHE only indicates what,
how
and where to poll*/<br>
/*the "algors" file is a file describing pre-defined algorithms for
transformation or custom mathematical calculations that may be needed
in the process of returning a value on some desired format or unit (for
example, the algor. requiered to transform from DAC units to volts, so
the response can be given in volts rather than DAC units)*/<br>

Note tha many entries here are "optional", and no all of the controller
will have/support them (like REGS, DACS, TP, etc).<br>
<br>
Since almost all the files are controller-dependent, we will describe
the ones for the supported controllers:<br>

 * added "memory mux" command support

2007-07-16T09:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.8
 * Improved the way the DAC file is read, and also the DAC handling
   (raw values, etc)

2007-07-16T09:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.7
 * Fixed multiple timing things. It now reads exp_overhead and seq_overhead
   as part of the timing calculations

2007-07-15T09:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.6
 * fixed the read_tp and write_tp that were passing the wrong arguments

2007-07-12T09:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.5
 * fixed the sync command argument
 * added a parsing for the sync. argument

2007-06-07T09:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.4
 * re-added the "sync" command to synchronize timing boards

2007-06-05T29:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.3
 * included modified version of the 2.6 kernel driver, fixed for multi
  processor and multiPCI environment

2007-05-29T29:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.2
 * added support for continuous read, by adding a cont_read global on
   the C code. Based on this variable the number of images os decremented 
   or not
 * added DO_IMREAD_CONT, that gets called when cont_read is set. This is like
   the normal imread, but simpler (no keys for TCS or FITS)

2006-08-07T29:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.1
  * fixed DO_IMREAD and timeout (queue from Logical)

2006-08-07T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 5.0
  * removed last dependencies with database. Full handling through DHE module

2006-06-07T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 4.5
  * added "get dettype"
  * fixed "get firmware"

2006-06-07T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 4.4
 * fixed some bugs with fixed_root thingi (like the imprefix and imsufix)
 * updated DEP file (Common 1.5)

2006-06-07T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 4.3
 * added the command "image.fixed_root", which allows to set a "baseline"
   directory upon all subsequent directory requests are based. This allows
   to set a directory so the clients cannot go beyond certain point
   (for example, if fixed_root could be /data/20060707/, so any image will be
    written beyond that point). If fixed_root is "/", then the system behaives
   as before

2006-06-07T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 4.2
 * Changed both the labview and the C support routine for stop_coadd to send
   an actual command to the DSP, changing the coadd number to 1, so acting
   as an efective "stop coadd". This is needed because coadd is handled on the
   DSP in version 1.7 of the DSP/driver (SDSU-III).
 * Fixed the old problem on "writeframes" on the mismatch between the set/get
   names for the frames. Now it can be used "expo" or "exposed", etc
 * Replaced the "SendAsyncMsg" for CMN_SendAsyncMsg, clearing the dependency
   with the aplication core. Increased the Common dependency to 1.3
 * added the "async send update" command to async. send many image parameters
   as "changed: IMVARS ...." (as basename, exposure, etc). Useful for script
   to force sync. on the gui
 * added also "async send <message>", so clients can force an async broadcast
  (dangerous, but useful)
 * changed the database variable for the firmare from "dhe_software" to 
    "dhe_firmware" (returned with "get firmware")
 * added the "stop_sample_up_the_ramp" in both C and Labview. 
 * Moved DO_IMREAD and DO_SDSUINIT to SDSU_DO_IMREAD and DSDU_DO_INIT
 * Moved INIT and EXPOSE to private/SDSU_INIT and private/SDSU_EXPOSE

2006-05-04T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 4.1
 * added the "support_hardtime" optional parameter under [Readout] on the
   config file (tru/false) to tell if hardware (DSP) frame time calculations
   are allowed or not. If they are, it issue the hardware command, if it not
   it uses the defined parameter under readout to calculate

2006-05-04T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 4.0
 * running under Linux kernel 2.6.X without any change to the Clibs, only the
   driver, so it now runs in either 2.4 or 2.6
 * added the command "get readmodes" that brings all the available readmodes.
 * Removed a lot of unnecesary dependencies with Database Module. Most of the
   globals are now SDSU globals
 * fixed some things related time calculation.

2006-04-01T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.81
 * Found bug in Labview 7.1. Labview generates an error whhen trying to access
  a caption not created. This caused a problem for the grt timminginfo
  command, who reads a cluster that had no captions visible. By making the
  captions visibles the problem get fixed. This may be a problem for some
   other modules also

 * Updated documentation


2006-03-03T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.8
 * added the command "dhe get frame_time", that reads the frame time from the
   DSP. Added the low level C read_frame_time on sdsdLib.c, that sends the
   command RFT to the timing board, and the upper labview driver on the same
   name. 
 * Created GetFrameTimeFromHardware to call the above command, and set it
   on the database. If the command is not available on the DSP (not
   implemented), it will use the usual way of calculating the read time
   (parameters from init file). Modified DO_IMREAD and SetTiming to use this
   vi
 * Added the command "dhe set exptime [<relative | absolute>]" used for
   select between corrected/uncorrected exposure time for the fowler/CDS
   frames. Modified DO_IMREAD to read a DBS variable with this info and
   correct or not accordingly
* Modified DACS so now both get and set take arguments of type *pattern*,
  just like any OS based command (for searching)


2005-12-02T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.7 
 * the macros now accept arguments. The command in the macro has to state
   "XXXX _ARG_[1] _ARG_[2]_ ..." and it wil be replaced by the arguments passed
   to the macro on the command line
 * added the "sync" command (set and get) for external sync. (more than 1
   controller in sync)
 * added the "get firmware" command that allows to read the tim.lod version 
   loaded (as it goes into the headers)
 * added the "set detformat colsxrows" that allows to change the size of the
   "on the fly". This can be used only with GEOM 3.4 or superior

2005-12-02T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.6
 * added the command "GET FPAINFO", and "GET DETINFO"
 * added DEP file

2005-11-02T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.5
 * added the capability of specified the datatype on the header TP file,
   like (FLOAT) tp VBIASGATE
 * now exposure time is corrected for true exposure time, on fowler sampling.

2005-05-27T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.4
 * Added the "minimu exposure time" parameter (alternate "min_exptime",
	under "Misc" on the config file. 
 * Added the dhe_software to the database, so it can be added into the headers
   In the SDSU case, it is the tim.lod file path 
 * Added the "InitMacro" global, and the "GET Initmacro" command, so clients
   can change programatically the macro (if using Arcview 2.4-> )

2005-05-13T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.3
 * fixed race condition on DO_IMREAD between the feed_buffers and the
  read_ended global variable

2005-05-12T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.2
 * added the capab. of changing the number of images on the fly
 * added the "image type" actions (by now only implemented the "dark" for not
  opening the shutter)

2005-04-24T27:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.1
 * added the cap. of changing exposure time on the fly 

2005-02-24T17:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 3.0
 * Labview 7.0
 * Many changes to support DBSP


2005-02-24T17:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.95
 * removed dependencies with ArcVIEW/Common (redirected to Modules/Common

2005-02-24T17:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.94
 * fixed the "set readmode" command (readmode was not wired)
 * fixed the "set readmode" command, adding the size change and the geometry
    and ROI calculations

2005-01-24T10:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.93
 * Added the support for "*" when setting a DAC (like "dac set off*" for all
the biases that starts with "off*"
 * Fixed the BIG probl;em on DO_IMREAD, where the queue waiting for the Logic 
   process to finish was timing out before the read finished (if more than 60
   seconds)
 * Oncreased the resolution og of the value of the DAC/OFFSETS on the headers
   to 3 decimal points (to mV accuracy)

2005-05-29T10:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.92
 * DO_IMREAD wires the error to the CMN_addststusmessage

2004-12-29T10:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.91
 * added the posibility of adding the DAC offsets to the headers, as
  testpoints. Modified SDSU_DACS.vi

2004-11-29T10:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.9
 * Changed the response sheme. It returns now "DONE" for short commands, and
   "OK (CB <estimated_timeout>)" for long (callback) commands

2004-11-29T10:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.8
 * Replaced ConfigVals for CMN_ConfigVals
 * Replaced the SDSUGlobal Buffers for CMN_GetBuffers and CMN_SetBuffers
 * Modified DO_IMREAD; now it sends a queue name to the Logical module, and
   this, instead of generating the callback automatically, sends the message
   back to the local queue, and it is DO_IMREAD who sends the callback. This
   makes the process cleaner and clearer.

2004-10-19T10:14:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.7
 * Added the macro capability (SDSU_Macro.vi) which allows to handle short
   sequences of commands 

2004-09-02T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.6
 * Added the support for ROI and binning. This includes changes on the clib
  (API) as well as the labview driver (P60 changes)
 * Added the "version" support (DHE version [-full])
 * modified the INIT option under ParseCmds. Now the error line from the vi
   that read the DAC file is not ocnnected to the one which calls the
   initialization. This because under Labview 7 an error is generated if not
   DAC file is found, causing the module to not initialize because of that
 * added a new Makefile for gcc 3.3 or superior. Adde the file
   COMPILING_README where the needed changed for compiling the driver are
    explained (if gcc is 3.3 or superior)

2004-07-07T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.4.1
 * Interim version with all the chages needed to spport ROI and Binning

2004-07-07T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.4
 * On astroLibIII.c, separated the optical from the IR exposure. Created 
   the expose_optical function. 

2004-07-02T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.3
  * taken out the hardcoded pci.lod loading on startup. Now it gets loaded
	as the tim or util.lod. Modified astroIIILib.c and sdsuLib.c
	This done in order to make ArcVIEW independent on the /home dir.

2004-02-06T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.2
  * added the return of options when command is sent without arguments

2004-02-06T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 2.1
  * Zillions of Changes, mostly related with the DBShandler thing.
	Not compatible with previous versions
  * added Sample Up the Ramp support

2004-02-06T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.2.3
  * Fixed the INIT.vi. Now the path to the init macro can be a relative one
  * Now the DAC file can have constant definitions, avoiding the annoying
    task of repeating values many times. If something changes, you just
    change the constant. Modifyed SDSU_ReadDACs.vi, and add
    SDSU_DAC_ReadConstans.vi

2004-02-06T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.2.2
  * Deleted the "askTCSInfo" vi from DO_IMREAD. Now it just calls the standard
    "toTCS" from the common module (independent on the TCS to which 
    is connected, if any. This avoids a nasty delay that was happening when
    it was not connected to any TCS
  * Added the "ALTERNATIVE" key on the list of available commands (through the
    command line). 

2004-02-05T20:12:46 UTC Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.2.1
  * Changed DO_IMREAD: replaced the tologic.vi from the logic module, for
    the one on Common

2004-02-02T19:43:17 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.2
  * added SDSU_CalRemainingExpTime vi.
  * TP values can be sent while exposing, if the remaining exposure time is
   greater than 15 secs, avoiding the danger of reading the memory when
   reading out, but alowing to do it while long-exposing
  * added the "START" command (as an alternative to INIT)
  * modified SDSU-IIMemory.vi so it strips the path for the "file"
    argument to verify if the last name in the path is "none"
  * Changed to the "parent.field" sintax for the SET/GET commands. Most
    of the old commands are still supported just for back compatibility
  * moved the "clib" directory to "src" on private/c/SDSUIII
  * SDSU-II was taken out, since it looms like it will not be supported
    anymore ....

2004-12-23T14:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.21
  * added the "opened" interlock on the astroIIILib.c, so it avoids
    reopening the driver when it is in use
  * added the "images_started" on the get_KEY routine (astrolib) so the
    the UTShut value is sent to labview at the begining of the image,
    allowing more time for the TCS info to arrive 
  * taken out the Mem_Array stuff from the astrolib, because it was not being
    used
  * Now, if it is busy (Check_Busy -on ParseCommand.vi, "EXPOSE" case), it
  * will return the error inmediatelly and will not call the DO_IMREAD. The
    callback gets done anyway by the Server itself, who detects the error and
    send it through the callback line. Otherwise, the "Pending Callback"
    global is overriden
  * Added a wire on DO_IMREAD, from the initial pointer clearence to the 
    sequence holding the "expose" call, defining an explicit order. In this
    we avoid a dangerous race condition of the pointers being cleared
    after they has been set by the exposure c routine

2004-12-15T14:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.20
  * ON EXPOSE.vi, added the imagestoread (DBS) variable for checking
    the disk space
  * On SET and GET, added the "type.field" (like "image.comment") alternative
    style for commands
  * On DO_IMREAD, added the "imagestatus=idle" when there is an error
    incoming (error case)
  * On DO_IMREAD, now the call to the Logic process occurs after the C 
    pointers are cleared (avoiding a dangerous race condition)
  * On DO_IMREAD, the imgstatus variable is never updated to "idle" from
    this routine, but only externally (busy state before calling this vi, and
    idle state only after this vi has finished). This ensures the state of the
    variable
  * Modified the CheckBusy..vi. A little while loop added, so it will wait
    some time (default 2 secs) if the imgstate is still busy
  * On the astroIIILib.c routine, the status of the detector (detstatus) is
    changed now before actually issuing the start_exposure command, so the
    status for the rest of the world is not idle even e little before the 
    exposure started. This avoided a possible race condition with the
    loop of the TPNT module (when asking for power supply data, etc)
  

2003-12-15T14:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.19
  * added the SDSU_DAC.vi, for handling the DAC definitions on the controller
   side
  * fixed a problem with the timoeout calculations when exposing
   (GetFromDBS.vi)

2003-12-03T19:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.18
  * fixed a problem on the template2key.vi (for updating the TP headers)
  * added the "on/off" option to both autoshutter and artif_data
  * changed autoshutter to the Y memory space instead of X (?)
  * added the while loop on both GoExpose and IRExpose, so if the DO_IMREAD
    is busy, it will attempt a couple of more times. If fails, converts the
    "1000" labview error to the "-1" unix error

2003-11-24T19:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.17
  * added the extra config option of sending a command to the hardware
    when chaning readmode. It can send the specified command, with the
    specified argument. If no specification is done on the config file
    then acts as before, sending nothing to the hardware when readmode
    is changed

2003-11-14T19:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.16
  * fixed the problem of mfpb ehrn reading a single frame (like in a ccd)
  * fixed the unclear error "samples" when no boot was made

2003-11-14T19:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.15
  * fixed the fowler/coadd/sequences for multiple frames per buffer
	(only SDSU-III). Now the coadds are handled by the dsp code
	on the timing board. 
  * added the "imstatus" as part of the response to "DHE GET progress", so
    it return now messages like ("waiting next frame", or "coadding" to the
    client)

2003-10-29T19:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.14.1
  * added the ".mc" capabilitie for initial macro
  * fixed many problems when reading out in continuos mode (frames per bufer)
    (CDS command to the dsp code). 
  * fixed stuff on the TP side (fixed over P60 machine)

2003-10-29T19:00:07 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.14
  * added the "deafault" and "default all" option to the SDSu_REGS.vi

2003-10-27T18:26:11 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.13
  * added the "CHANGE" option on the SDSU_ReadTPs.vi.
  * added the space for the TP2ARRAY

2003-10-20T20:06:55 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.12
  * Added all the REG capabilities for handling the RG devices or, in general,
    any register-oriented commands. Added the upper level SDSU_REGS.vi and
    all the lower level vis

2003-10-16T21:05:53 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.11
 * Added the "TP get -params" option for getting the parameters of a testpoint
   "TP params" is still supported
 * Fixed the "location:", by changing it "location=" on the TP2string vi

2003-10-08T21:38:18 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.10
 * Now it will switch automatically OFF the monitoring if the point is not
  responding for more than "maxerrs" (set on the TP definition file). This
  avoids the annoying "hangs" every x seconds when the controller is not
responding
 * Added the TP vi on the INIT.vi vi, so the commands can be set as 
   "commands when starting up", on the initialization file. 

2003-10-07T21:38:18 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.9

 * added the capability of writing the testpoints to the database,
    so they can be used in the headers (template file)

2003-10-01T20:21:13 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.8

 *added setpoint algoritms (read and write algoritms)

2003-09-30T17:06:28 UTC <Marco Bonati> SDSU version 1.1.5

* added telemetry (TP vis). This includes the algorithms things

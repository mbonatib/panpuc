Astropci Driver Version 1.7 - Fedora Core 4

This driver has been tested under Redhat Fedora Core 4 (kernel 2.6.11-1.1369).
Although it has not been tested, the driver has been written so that it
should compile and run on Fedora Core 2 (kernel 2.4.x).

Changes made to upgrade from Core 2 (kernel 2.4.x) to Core 4 (kernel 2.6.11):
1. Now uses "remap_pfn_range" instead of obsolete "remap_page_range".
2. The "readl", "readw", "writel", and "writew" functions are now defined to
   pass pointer addresses instead of integer addresses.
3. "pci_dev->slot_name" has been replaced with "pci_name(pci_dev)".

IMPORTANT:
---------
The computer must be rebooted after running astropci_unload. This is a
known bug that will cause readout to fail if you do not reboot before
running astropci_load again.

Before compiling, you must make sure the following directory exists. If
it does not, then you must become root and create it. This directory is
where the astropci.ko file will be installed.

/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra

In order for this driver to function, the following line must be set in
LILO (/etc/lilo.conf) or grub (/etc/grub.conf).

GRUB:
----
Edit the file /etc/grub.conf and append "mem=xxxM memap=yyyM$xxxM"
to the end of the line "kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda2", where
xxx is the amount of RAM you DO NOT want to use for an image buffer
and yyy is the size of the image buffer you want. So, if your computer
has 512Mb of RAM and you want to have a 12Mb image buffer, you must
append the following: "mem=500M memmap=12M$500M". If this doesn't work,
try using a '#' instead of '$':  "mem=500M memmap=12M#500M".

Here's an excerpt from the above link:
 I recently learnt that limiting RAM with by using only "mem=xxxM" is no
  good on machines equipped with PCI.  In my case (vanilla 2.6.9) the cardbus
  bridge on my laptop got mapped to the unused RAM area which resulted in
  wierd errors due to the collision.
  
  The right solution is to use "mem=" together with "memmap=" to mark the
  unused RAM area reserved.
  
  Henceforth I force the kernel to use 2016MiB by passing "mem=2016M
  memmap=32M#2016M" instead of just "mem=2016M".


Example:
-------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Edit /etc/grub.conf to append the "mem=xxxM memmap=yyyM" line:

default=0
timeout=10
splashimage=(hd1,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
title Fedora Core (2.6.5-1.358)
        root (hd1,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.5-1.358 ro root=LABEL=/ rhgb quiet mem=500M memmap=12M#500M
        initrd /initrd-2.6.5-1.358.img
title Other
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)
        chainloader +1

3) Reboot the computer.

To Load The Driver:
------------------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Run ./astropci_load


The current directory contains the following files:
astropci_main.c:	Main source file. 
astriopci_defs.h: 	General variables and structures definitions
astropci_io.h: 		Entry points for accesing the driver using user-code
			(basically ioctl command definitions)
Makefile: 		Makefile ...
astro_load: 		Simple script for loading the driver to the kernel.
			It will create all the necessary entries for using
	    		the driver. Read the little explanation on the script
	    		itself.
astro_unload: 		Script for unloading the driver from the kernel

When you compile the source, you are going to get the module: astropci.ko.

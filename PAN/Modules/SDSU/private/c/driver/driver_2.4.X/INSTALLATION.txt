SDSU driver system installation
-------------------------------

In order the SDSU ArcVIEW module to run, the proper driver must be loaded to
the running kernel.

For loading the driver, please see the READ_ME file under the src dir.
If you want the driver to be loaded automatically at startup time, then
you must be sure that the astropci_load script gets ran automatically
(it loads the driver to the kernel, and creates the appropiate entry on the
/dev directory). The easiest way is to copy the astropci_load_system script
to some common place (like /usr/local/bin), and then call it at start time from
/etc/rc.local

For installing the driver on the standard /lib/modules/<release>, then run "make
install" after "make". The astropci_load_system script will try to load it
from there

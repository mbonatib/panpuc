Astropci Driver Version 1.6

This driver uses a single large buffer for DMA transfer, unlike the previous
version 1.4. This driver has been tested under Redhat 7.1, using kernel 2.4.2-2.
It WILL NOT work with older kernels.

IMPORTANT:
---------
In order for this driver to function, the following line must be set in
LILO (/etc/lilo.conf): append="mem=xxxM", where xxx is the amount of RAM you
DO NOT want to use for an image buffer. So, if your computer has 128Mb of
RAM and you want to have a 28Mb image buffer, you must have the following line
in LILO (/etc/lilo.conf): append="mem=100M".

Example:
-------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Edit /etc/lilo.conf to have the append="mem=xxxM" line:

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.2-2
	label=linux
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda5
	append="mem=100M"

3) From a tcsh, execute the command:  lilo -v

4) Reboot the computer.

To Load The Driver:
------------------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Run ./astropci_load

The current directory contains the following files:
astropci_main.c:	Main source file. 
astriopci_defs.h: 	General variables and structures definitions
astropci_io.h: E	Entry points for accesing the driver using user-code (basically
			ioctl command definitions)
Makefile: 		Makefile ...
astro_load: 		Simple script for loading the driver to the kernel. It will create
	    		all the necesary entrys for using the driver. Read the little
	    		explanation on the script itself.
astro_unload: 		Script for unloading the driver from the kernel

When you compile the source, you are going to get two modules: astropci.o and
astropci_g.o . The only diference between this is that the last one generate
some debug information to the messages file.

- astroLibIII.c	: sources for readout/control from ArcVIEW
- readLib.h	: header definitions
- driver_funcs.h: header declarating calls from the driver API source

Makefile.src: makefile for generating a shared library using the driver api sources
Makefile.static: makefile for generating a shared library linking to a static
		 library containing the driver api calls.

Important NOTE: The natural (and cleanest) thing to use here would be to link with
		a static library. However, Labview seems to have problems when
		the shared library was generated in that way. This is why the 
		"Makefile.src" is provided

driver_api dir:
	Pure API for the controller. This API can be called or used by any client
	See README inside directory

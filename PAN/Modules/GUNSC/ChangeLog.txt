	* labview 2014
	* tested for 64bits native OS

2013-02-28T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 10.4
	* fixed the passing of pointers to DSENDER (missing pointer in
	 compute)

2012-05-30T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 10.3
	* replaced double_t with pan_double_t to avoid conflict with mathdefs
	in newer kernels

2012-05-30T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 10.2
	* updated C documentation (Doxygen)

2011-11-08T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 10.1
	* no debug

2011-10-18T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 10.0
	* fixed a problem with UL unscrambling -shift by 1 pixel-
	(fixed GU_algors, the UL case, added a "-1" to the *(dataptr...=*(rawptr...)

2011-07-20T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 9.4
	* fixed a problem when using detector extensions and some
	detector where not being read (none). Added GU_getdet
	to locate the right index. 
	* Also modified ADDDet.vi for to include detnumber in the
	detector structure

2011-07-15T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 9.3
	* handles disabled + detextensions (GU_Algors)
	* "enable" with no args returns the state (on/off)
 
2011-05-16T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 9.2
	* some small changes to avoid warnings in come compilers

2011-04-24T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 9.1
	* tested the C library in a 64 bits machine
	Ready for labvie 64b, if ever comes

2011-03-24T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 9.0
	* changed so it is, in theory, 64bits safe.
	* added custom typedefs, and the handling of the labview/c
	pointer passing is all done in 64 bits (converted to 32 in C
	if the OS is 32 bits

2010-10-12T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 8.4
	* aded some commands to make the physmap friendler
	(writekey physmap / writekey get_physmap)

2010-10-12T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 8.3
	* fixed the y shuffling, that was moving just half the data
	(no bytes_pp in the memcpy)

2010-09-25T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 8.2
	* added the type to the detectors structure. This is useful
	  only when using "single" sampling.
	* for the previous thing, ensured that the detector structure
	  gets always added before the amplifier structure

2010-09-16T23:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 8.1
	* fixed a small mesage (replaced ERR: by the standard ERROR)
	* Since 8.0, the dynamic unscrambling functions (GU_SHORT, etc)
	have an extra parameter to pass the error (int *err)

2010-09-16T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 8.0
	* the detext rearranging can now be done in chuncks
	(for usage in real time sampling/reducing, as "single")

2010-09-16T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 7.1
	* Added time debug, taken off some printf statements

2010-05-22T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 7.0
	* added the capability of swapping sections (pre/post/data) after the
	  unscrambling -shuffling them around- on request 
	* added the commands "get/set order"
	* untested with real detectors yet

2010-05-22T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 6.1
	* fixed "version" command

2010-04-05T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 6.0
	* added "discard" flag to amplifiers. It does nothing to the
	* unscrambler, but gets passed to GFITS so the amplifiers is
	  nor writen to disk (read from controller but discarded)

2009-10-22T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 5.4
	* small comment taken out of the debug window because it was confusing

2009-05-17T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 5.3
	* added the flad "pix_swap" "(command "set pix_swap 0 | 1)"
	  to accomodate for a monsoon bug that sends the pixels swapped in
	  some cases (when readin single amplifiers)

2009-05-17T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 5.2
	* fixed a couple of simple things (disable would not work unless at
	* least 1 unscrambling had been done before. This was fixed)
	* Deleted the "scr.fits" on the test (17 megs! and never used)

2009-05-06T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 5.1
	* Added the detext capability to bpp=16 and bpp=(float)32, that was
	* forgotten (not added) before

2009-02-26T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 5.0
	* It can handle structures for per-detector information. Gets the
	information from thr GEOM (5.0->), and then, if selected, it can
	generate per-detector structures immediately after discrambling,
	passing those structures to the external workld (GFITS, etc), so
	each detetcor looks now as an amplifier (for the rest)

2009-01-15T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 4.3
	* Modified so the cont_read is ANDed with the memfits var
	 (so it can run in cotinuous-run mode and "writing" fits
	 IF they are memfits files

2008-07-16T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 4.2
	* added the OSU svn tags

2008-07-16T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 4.1
	* added the enable/disable unscrambling. Modified both C libraries and
	 labview libraries ("enable on/off" that causes the data to be passed
	 as it came in the raw buffer)

2008-07-04T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 4.0
	* modified the input from the GEOM module to better handle non-square
	 FPAs

2008-06-04T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.6
	* fixed unscrambling bug for UR amplifiers (found at Palomar Mount)

2007-05-29T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.5
	* reads the variable "cont_read" to send or not info/requests to
	  the GFITS module. If cont_read, then assumes no image will be
	  written, so no fits commands are sent

2007-03-22T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.4
        * fixed the command line interface to allow writekey commands

2006-05-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.3
	* update DEP file (Common 1.6, guider vis)

2006-05-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.2
	* Removed dependencies with database	
	* Created the GUNSC_inspect errors, that used the database errnostr

2005-05-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.1
	* fixed a bug on the RI_SHORT routine, under GU_transformations.c
	* added the DEP file

2005-05-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 3.0
	* Labview 7.0

2005-02-19T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 2.4
	* taken out dependencies with ArcVIEW/Common 
	* added the "VERSION" command
	* taken out the debug by default

2004-11-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 2.3
	* Some changes regarding negative pointers being returned (and not
	* errors) because of some o.s. memory managment. This was seen during
          the P60 upgrade. The changes were merged here. Basically, changes on
          GUNSC_Main.vi and some others (unwiring the pointer and wiring a 0, 
          meaning "no error"

2004-11-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 2.2
	* Replaced ConfigVals for CMN_ConfigVals


2004-07-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 2.1
	* Changed the C library so now the dinamic unscrambling library
	  isa not hardcoded, but passed at initialization time. Changed
	  GU_open to take the path argument. Modified GUNSC_Main.vi to
	  pass the argument at the begining. This was done in order to make
	  the module independent on the /home directory

2003-10-27T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 2.0
	* Started using the DBSHANDLER module for database storage

2003-10-27T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 1.8
	* changed the call to the GFITS module from "write" to 
	  "writeamps". Note that now it must be used with version
	 1.8 --> of the GFITS module

2003-10-07T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 1.7
        *deleted the ampsptr variable 

2003-10-03T21:07:10 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 1.6
	*fixed the multiple extensions thing (kirmos)
	

2003-04-23T06:32:09 UTC <Marco Bonati> GUNSC version 1.5

	*added _DEBUG_ directive to the C source

2003-08-20T00:44:28 UTC

	*added verification of number of amplifiers versus extensions array.
Now it will update the size of the update array accoringly. 
		- Created GUNSC_verifyNumberExtensions.vi (on private/vis)

2003-08-21T21:38:07 UTC M.B.

	*created config directory and default configuration file
	*added "commands" handling at initialization (through configuration
file)
	*added "SetPhysMap" function for changing the Physsical map between
	defined amplifiers and physical cables on mount.
		- Added on GUnscramble.c and GU_algors.c
	*Modified GUNSC_Str2Extensions.vi in order to handle more diectives
	*Created GUNSC_LibSetPhysMap.vi for calling new function.
	*Modified GUNSC_Main.c at the WRITEKEY --> physmap for making new C
call (PhysMap)

	* fixed "pause", changing the the "set_timeout" subvi
	
2011-03-04T14:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 6.3
	* added more commands to DBS ("get *name*", "get groups",

	* added the capability of calling  a shutdown macro (or commands) when
	  shutdown (before shutting doen the modules)
	* added _MACROPATH_ as a global variable, so it can be used to reference
	  a script or path

2010-04-04T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 4.2
	* added the applicaton name to /tmp/arcproc,so the same user

2010-03-26T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 4.1
	* changed all the "/tmp/arcproc"  in the csh scripts
	 (public/bin) by a vairable that includes the user
	 (whoami) so multiple instances can be started by multiple users
	 in the same machine without colliding. Modified start_pan and
	  shutdown_pan

2010-01-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 4.0
	* fixed an important buag related to the timout modification when an
	* exposure was in progres (any 'set" command while exposing would take
	  the exposure timeout to 30 secs). Fixed the PAN timeout Mngr

2010-01-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.98
	* Improvments in dbs handling variables (done in echelle run)
	* appmacro can now be recursive

2009-12-01T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.97
	* added "-no_proc_check" option to start_pan, to disable
	 checking for another instance of the same fpa

2009-11-18T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.96
	* added the option of adding the nodeID in the immediate replies
	  (app addid <on | off>)

2009-10-05T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.95

		-id: starts the debug window, but minimized

2009-09-23T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.94
	* Now pan can execute multiple semicolon-separated commands; the
	  response is also semicolon-separated (one per issued command
	* fixed "dbs set" so the string types can have multiple words

2009-08-15T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.93
	* Small change in the way the app name is requested at startup

2009-05-15T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.92
	* Improved the pan macro handling. It can now handle a system
	  command (like a csh script) as if it was a macro
	* Changed the name of the core macros to "appmacro" to
	  avoid confusion with the "dhe macro"

2009-05-05T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.91
	* Modified PAN_ParseCmd so the tcp servers also understand the
	* _nodeID_ in front of the command
	 (so it is possible to send "_nodeID_ expose", for example)

2009-03-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.9
	* fixed the "deep" image translation (field separation is now using
	"->" instead of "_" (dhe->set->shutter), and it now truly supports 
	multiple ttranslations to the same module.
	
2009-03-02T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.8
	* Improved the DBS handling of queued variables (added "preview",
	 "set" for queues, etc)

2009-02-06T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.7
	* The translations allow to have a deep command to be translated onto
	  another module also, by adding "_" in the definition. For example
 	  dhe_set_shutter="SHUTTER", would translate the command
	  "dhe set shutter open" into "SHUTTER open" (so handled by the
	  module SHUTTER rather than the module DHE)
	  This gives more flexibility for implementing specific
	  hardware configutaions
	* Added the capability of starting, on the fly, a module that was not listed on the
	  config file, by issuing the command "MOD XXX START"

2009-01-19T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.6
	* Communication modules were talen out of the core. They are now
	  external modules -as the command sets-
	* changed a bit start_pan so it will pass any unknown argument to
	  labview (so labview can parse it)
	* the start_pan uses the new "get_port" instead of modkey. "get_port"
	  allows to specify the command set (port on) you want to talk to
	* get_port also allows expresions of the type ${PORT}+1
	* get_modkey (used by get_port) can also read enviromental variables

2009-01-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.5
	* Changed the vis with a "?" in their name (under coms)
	* Fixed the case, at the intial sequence, for reading the errno.h file

2008-12-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.4
	* the "async" commands does not get passed to the async
	  while loop, but executed (sent) only  on the DHE
	  module. This avoids duplication of async. messages
	  and ensures manual async. messages when exposing
	  (problem reported by Dave Hale)

2008-12-12T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.3
	* fixed the errno_default finding

2008-09-29T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.2
	* CmdSet taken out of private. Now they are independent modules
	  (CmdSet<name>)

2008-09-29T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.1
	* added a lot of new handling on the MNSN cmdset
	* fixed several problems on the DBS handling
	* added the option of passing "-hold" as a parameter to the debug
	  window (Thanks to Dave Hale!)
	
2008-09-29T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 3.0
	* labview 8.6
	* fixed the "app version" command
	* added more commands on the mnsn command set
	* fixed a couple of open references being left at mult_tcp (1&2)
	* added som emore help for commands (app commands)

2008-08-22T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.8
	* Added some vis to support generic long commands (not only from
	  DHE)

2008-08-09T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.7
	* Added the _CMDLINE_ option for the id (name given on cmdline)
	* Improved the naming (nodeID)

2008-08-08T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.6
	* Added the capability of defining the id as the parent of the
	  config file, by defining id (on the main config file) as 
	  _DIRNAME_. This allows to copy the whole application to a 
	  new directory without the need of editing the application
	  name
	* modified the start_pan script so if it sees the id _DIRNAME_
	  it extracts the name of the parent directory (just to not confuse
	  the user with the echos on the name)

2008-07-31T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.5
        * added a delay of 2000 ms in long actions, to avoid race conditions
          if the callback comes back too close (so a long action cannot take
          less than 2 secs)
        * ensured the adding of the timeout to the timeout manager before
          the actual action is called (also to avoid race conditions)


2008-07-31T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.4
	* fixed the unclose reference in the mult_tcp protocols
	* new config file to support multiple com. protocols

2008-02-31T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.3
	* added the ID in the async. connections

2008-01-31T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.2
	* added the report in PM_scan_versions

2008-01-30T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.1
	* fixed PM_ModsInfo

2008-01-29T21:55:23 UTC <Marco Bonati> PAN version 2.0
	* first in rep.

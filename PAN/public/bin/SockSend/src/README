This simple program takes arguments from the standard input and writes it to the
specified host:port. THis program can be used from a Csh script
(see the Csh directory in this demos), or from a compiled program (as a
system call, for example).


usage:

soksendcmd [-?] [-h hostname] [-p portnumber] [-t timeout] [-m mode] "message"

-? : print the usage message
timeout is in seconds
<mode> can be:
	0: waits for the response, but no more than <timeout> secs
	1: send the cmd, and do not wait for the response


This program works fine over LINUX. If you want to use in in a diferent 
platform, like Solaris or SunOS, you should review the error values.
 For example, in Linux it returns EGAIN when you peform a read in a 
Non-Blocking mode, but in SunOS this will be EWOULDBLOCK. 
I didn't include all this here cause this is just a demo .....

M.B.
